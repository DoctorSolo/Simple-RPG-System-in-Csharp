<h1 align=center>Simple RPG System in C#</h1>

<p>I created this project to challenge myself. It contains a dictionary with dictionaries inside that store the entity's data, and each entity has its own ID that is generated automatically and without repetition, except for the player's ID that I always assign as 0. </p>

<p>I am proud of the result and I am open to changes made by you. I hope you like it, and see you soon. </p>
